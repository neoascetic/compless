========

**It's like [compass][], but for [less][]**

Mixins  are divided  into categories  in  a way  how  it done  in the  compass'
[reference][]. See sources to find what is already implemented.

To start using  this set, simply extract an [archive][]  into folder where your
less  files lie,  rename extracted  directory  to `compless`  and put  `@import
"compless/all"` on the top of your stylesheet.

The main purpose of  this project is to give a developer  mixins set similar to
[compass' one][reference]. So, if you want  to create a pull request, make sure
that new functionality as similar to compass' analogues as possible.

However,  sometimes compass  doesn't  fit our  need. Because  of  this we  have
support for mixins called "extensions". They all have "e-" prefix.
